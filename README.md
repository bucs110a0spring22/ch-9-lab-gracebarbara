## SUMMARY:
 First, I created a Rectangle class that includes the __init__ method which sets the x and y coordinates and the height and width as instance variables and setting any parameter less than 0 to 0 using if statements. The __str__ method takes these instance variables and returns a string that defines the values of the x and y coordinates and the height and width. The surface class uses the __init__ method to take the filename string as a parameter and saves it to the self.image instance variable. Also, it takes a x, y set of coordinates, as well as a width and height, and creates a rectangle object stored in self.rect using the imported Rectangle class. The getRect method returns the rectangle object. The main function calls to each of these class methods and checks their functionality using assert.
